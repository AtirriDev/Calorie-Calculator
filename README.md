# Calorie-Calculator
Calorie Calculator project. This project was developed during my early days at university, where I applied my knowledge in nutrition to create a calorie calculator based on the Harris-Benedict formulas. .In the near future, I have plans to enhance this project, particularly in terms of its visual appeal and user experience.

// Work done with C# .NET
